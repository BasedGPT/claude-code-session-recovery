Something broke somewhere with your sessions in Claude Desktop. Because I'm a bit special I've broken my Desktop sessions in lots of different ways. I made this to help you diagnose and hopefully fix it if something has gone wrong for you too.

## Paste this into Claude Code to fix it

If you want Claude Code to diagnose and repair your sessions for you, paste this:

```
My Claude Code sessions are broken on Windows.
Please help me by:
1. Cloning https://github.com/BasedGPT/claude-code-session-recovery to a temp folder
2. Running `python tools/diagnose.py`
3. Reading the output and running the repair command it recommends
4. Telling me what was found and what was fixed

The diagnostic is read-only. Repair tools only modify session metadata — they do not touch conversation history.
```

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/BasedGPT/claude-code-session-recovery
cd claude-code-session-recovery
python tools/diagnose.py
```

Read the output. It prints what it found, the matched problem, and the exact repair command if one exists. The diagnostic is read-only — safe to run at any time.

## Where to start

**Sessions in your Claude Desktop session list are broken or missing** → [docs/session-recovery.md](docs/session-recovery.md)

**You use Claude Code worktrees and something broke** → [docs/worktree-lifecycle.md](docs/worktree-lifecycle.md)

**You want to understand the bug before running anything** → [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)

**You want to know what the scripts touch before running them** → [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

**You are an AI assistant helping a user with this repo** → [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)

## Symptom table

Run `python tools/diagnose.py` first — it identifies your specific problem and prints the exact command to run.
